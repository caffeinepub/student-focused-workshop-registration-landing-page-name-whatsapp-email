  "summary": "REQ-23/24/25 appear largely implemented: registration success triggers a best-effort top-level redirect to the exact WhatsApp URL; success/duplicate UIs no longer show WhatsApp join buttons/copy; the floating CTA now shows the visible label text \"Join WhatsApp group\" and opens the exact invite link. One acceptance criterion (non-overlap with submit button on common mobile viewports) is not verifiable from the diff summary.",
