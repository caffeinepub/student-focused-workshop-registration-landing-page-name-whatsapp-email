  "summary": "The diff implements the requested social-proof popup system with configurable timing/lists and storage-backed non-repeating name logic, and it appears to add the requested trust indicator under the registration CTA. One key REQ-2 acceptance criterion is not met based on the popup text layout: the popup message is split across two lines rather than displaying the exact single-string format.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "A notification card appears in the bottom-left corner of the landing page and displays exactly: “{Name} from {City} registered {TimeAgo}”.",
      "reason": "The popup UI renders the message in two separate <p> elements: the first shows “{Name} from {City}” and the second shows “registered {TimeAgo}”, rather than displaying the exact full string as a single continuous text line.",
